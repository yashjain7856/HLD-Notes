### *Introduction - Part 2*

- This video is a continuation of Part 1, which discussed the "Decompose by Medium Position Pattern".
- The video focuses on three important patterns:
    - *Strangler Pattern:* Used for *refactoring* a monolithic service into microservices.
    - *Saga Pattern:* Solves the problem of *distributed transactions* across multiple databases.
    - *CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):* Separates command (write) and query (read) operations for improved performance and scalability.

### *Strangler Pattern:*

- *Purpose:* Gradually refactoring a monolithic application into microservices.
- *How it Works:*
    - A "controller" is introduced to handle requests.
    - Initially, the controller forwards all traffic to the monolithic application.
    - Gradually, specific functionalities are extracted into microservices, and the controller routes traffic to them.
    - As more functionalities are migrated, the controller forwards less traffic to the monolithic application, eventually strangling it.
- *Advantages:*
    - Minimizes disruption to existing services.
    - Allows for a gradual transition to microservices.
- *Example:*
    - Imagine a monolithic e-commerce website being refactored into microservices.
    - The controller initially directs all traffic to the monolithic website.
    - Gradually, functionalities like order placement, inventory management, and payment processing are moved to individual microservices.
    - The controller gradually routes more traffic to these microservices, eventually reducing the reliance on the monolithic application.

### *Data Management in Microservices:*

- *Two Approaches:*
    - *Database for Each Individual Service:* Each microservice has its own dedicated database, promoting autonomy and isolation.
    - *Shared Database:* All microservices share a single database, simplifying data access but potentially leading to complexities.
- *Why Database per Service is Preferred:*
    - *Scalability:* Allows for independent scaling of individual services without impacting others.
    - *Isolation:* Changes in one service's database don't affect others.
    - *Technology Flexibility:* Services can choose different databases based on their specific needs.
- *Advantages of Shared Database*
    - Join Query
    - Transactional Property (ACID)
- *Drawbacks of Shared Database:*
    - *Performance Bottlenecks:* Increased contention and performance issues as more services access the same database.
    - *Complexity:* Managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across multiple services becomes difficult.
    - *Limited Scalability:* Scaling the entire database is necessary, even if only one service needs more resources.

### *SAGA Pattern:*

- *Purpose:* Managing distributed transactions across multiple databases, ensuring data consistency even if some operations fail.
- *How it Works:*
    - A sequence of local transactions is executed within each participating microservice.
    - Each transaction updates the database and publishes an event.
    - Subsequent transactions listen to these events and continue the process.
    - In case of failure, compensation events are published to undo completed operations and maintain consistency.
- *Types of Sagas:*
    - *Choreography:* Each service manages its own transactions and listens to events from other services.
    - *Orchestration:* A centralized orchestrator manages the transaction flow and handles compensation logic.
- *Example:*
    - An order processing saga involving services for order creation, inventory management, and payment processing.
    - If the payment service fails, compensation events are triggered to cancel the order and update inventory.
- *Advantages:*
    - Guarantees data consistency in distributed systems.
    - Provides a mechanism for handling failures and rollbacks.
    - Allows for flexibility in service interactions.
- *Disadvantages:*
    - Increased complexity compared to local transactions.
    - Requires careful design and implementation to ensure correctness.
- *Interview Question Example:*
    - Explain how you would handle a transaction involving transferring money between two users in a microservice architecture.

### *CQRS Pattern (Command Query Request Segregation):*

- *Purpose:* Separating read (query) operations from write (command) operations for better performance and scalability.
- *How it Works:*
    - The system maintains separate models for read and write operations.
    - Write operations are performed through commands, updating the write model.
    - Read operations access the read model, which can be optimized for fast retrieval.
- *Advantages:*
    - *Performance Improvement:* Optimized read models can handle queries more efficiently.
    - *Scalability:* Read and write models can be scaled independently based on their specific needs.
    - *Flexibility:* Allows for different data structures and query languages for read and write operations.
- *Example:*
    - A blog application where write operations are performed on a relational database, while read operations access a denormalized view optimized for fast search.
- *Challenges:*
    - Maintaining consistency between the read and write models.
    - Ensuring the read model is up-to-date with changes in the write model.
